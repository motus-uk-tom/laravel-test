# The Task

Your task is to create a simple forum using PHP and the Laravel Framework.

The application should have the following functionality:

1. Guest users can see all the threads
2. Only logged in users can start a thread or leave a comment on a thread
3. Comments can be upvoted, by logged in users, but should show the number of votes to all users
4. Users can register, login, logout
5. Threads can be filtered by category

# Considerations

The task is only for showing PHP Laravel experience and you should spend a maximum of 2 hours working on it. Don't worry if all the listed functionality isn't completed in this time it will still be accepted for review. Try to ensure what functionality you have attempted is working.

# Submitting

Email us a link to a public repository on github (or similar) or zip up your project directory and email as an attachment.
